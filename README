llgal installation instructions
===============================

You don't care about this if you use Debian or Gentoo prepackaged
versions that are available on http://bgoglin.free.fr/llgal

Run 'make install' as root.

By default, everything is installed in /usr/local/.
Most directories might be replaced by overriding their default values
on the command line.
For instance, a traditional installation might be achieved with
 make install PREFIX=/usr SYSCONFDIR=/etc MANDIR=/usr/share/man

Note that 'make uninstall' (with same options) allows to uninstall.

llgal requirements
==================

llgal requires perl and imagemagick packages.
The following perl libraries are also needed:
* libimage-info-perl
* libimage-size-perl
* liburi-perl
These dependencies are automatically installed when installing
Debian or Gentoo prepackaged versions.

If you need to install these libraries by yourself, you may find
tarballs in Debian source archives (for instance):
ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/libi/libimage-info-perl/libimage-info-perl_*.orig.tar.gz
ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/i/image-size/image-size_*.orig.tar.gz
ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/libu/liburi-perl/liburi-perl_*.orig.tar.gz
Replace * with the last version that you'll find.
llgal currently works with versions 1.16/2.992/1.35.


If you experience any problem,
