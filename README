llgal installation instructions
===============================

You don't care about this if you use Debian or Gentoo prepackaged
versions that are available on http://bgoglin.free.fr/llgal.

Run 'make' followed by 'make install' as root.

If you don't want or can't install as root, you may use
'make install DESTDIR=/home/login/where/you/want'.
Note that you need to pass the same DESTDIR parameter
during compilation (with 'make') since the installation
directory is hardcoded in llgal.

By default, everything is installed in /usr/local/.
Most directories might be replaced by overriding their default values
on the command line.
For instance, a traditional installation might be achieved with
 make install PREFIX=/usr SYSCONFDIR=/etc MANDIR=/usr/share/man \
	LOCALEDIR=/usr/share/locale

Note that 'make uninstall' (with same options) allows to uninstall.

llgal requirements
==================

llgal requires perl and imagemagick packages.
The following perl libraries are also needed:
* Image::ExifTool
* Image::Size
* URI
* Locale::gettext
These dependencies are automatically installed when installing
Debian or Gentoo prepackaged versions.

If you need to install these libraries by yourself, you may
for instance find them on CPAN:
* http://search.cpan.org/~exiftool/Image-ExifTool-6.00/lib/Image/ExifTool.pod
* http://search.cpan.org/~rjray/Image-Size-2.992/Size.pm
* http://search.cpan.org/~gaas/URI-1.35/URI.pm
* http://search.cpan.org/~pvandry/gettext-1.05/gettext.pm
llgal is known to work with these versions.
