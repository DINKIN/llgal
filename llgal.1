.SH NAME
llgal \- On-line gallery generator


.SH SYNOPSIS
.B llgal
.I [-option1 -option2 ...]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.B llgal
is a quick and easy program for placing your images and movies online with
just one command-line. It generates a pretty good-looking set of static HTML
slides even with its default settings.  To try it out just run
.B llgal
in a directory with
.BR "jpg" ", " "png" ", " "mpg" ", etc"
files and check the output in a web browser.  You can adjust the
appearance of the image gallery with the many options listed below or
(if you know a bit of HTML) by modifying the
.I llgal.css
files in the
.I .llgal/
subdirectory that appeared in your image directory, or
by defining
.IR "indextemplate.html" " or " "slidetemplate.html" " files."

llgal also checks for the existence of a
.I $HOME/.llgal/
directory where users can store their own templates, overriding the
site-wide
.IR "/usr/share/llgal" "."
(See
.B FILES
for details).

The HTML webpages are generated from the templates by replacing
several fields
(See
.BR TEMPLATES ).
The layout might be configured through the list of options
that are given in
.BR "LAYOUT" "."

llgal uses all images and videos it finds in the current directory.
See
.B SELECTING FILES
to include directories or other files and excludes some filenames.

The index includes thumbnails that llgal generates from original
images.
It is possible to provide custom thumbnails by placing them in the
.I .llgal/
directory with the
.I mythumb_
prefix.
Custom thumbnails for movies have to be suffixed with an image-type
extension.

The slide pages may include a scaled image in the
.B --sx
or
.B --sy
option is passed.
It is also possible to define custom scaled images with the
.I myscaled_
prefix to appear in the slides.

Note that all command line options (except those from
.BR "BEHAVIOR OPTIONS" ),
and even more, might be stored in a configuration file
to help generation of multiple galleries with the same
layout.
See
.B CONFIGURATION
for details.


.SH BEHAVIOR OPTIONS

By default, llgal generates a gallery.
If one of the following option is passed,
it will process it and exit immediately.

.TP
.B --clean
Remove all files that llgal may have created earlier and that user did
not modify since.

.TP
.B --cleanall
Remove all files that llgal may have created earlier. This includes
thumbnails, scaled down slides, all HTML files, captions file, film
effect picture, indextemplate and slidetemplate and the style-sheet
file.

.TP
.B --gc
Generate slide captions in
.I .llgal/captions
file that you may edit.  The format of this file is very simple.
.RB "See " CAPTIONS " for details."
These captions may then be modified by the user.
The file will be automatically used next time
.B llgal
is invoked.
.B --gc
might also be used to update the
.I captions
file when new files were added to the working directory.

.TP
.BI --gt " [<dir>]"
Copy template files to the directory.
The special value
.I local
might be used for the local
.I .llgal/
directory, while
.I user
might be used for the user
template directory
.IR $HOME/.llgal/ .
Any other directory is acceptable.
llgal will create the target directory if it does not exist.
The argument is optional.
Its default value is
.BR local .
See
.B FILES
for details about template files.

.TP
.B -h, --help
Display brief help.

.TP
.B -V, --version
Display llgal version.


.SH ADDITIONAL BEHAVIOR OPTIONS

llgal behavior may be modified with the following options,
either when generating a gallery or not.

.TP
.BI --config " <file>"
Read the file
.I file
as a configuration.
See
.B CONFIGURATION
for details.
Note that
.B --config
may be used several times on the same command line.

.TP
.BI -d " <dir>"
Operate in directory
.I <dir>
when generating the HTML files, thumbnails and scaled images.
The default is the current directory.

.TP
.B -f
Force thumbnail regeneration.  Also forces medium-slide regeneration if
.BR --sx " or " --sy
is given.  Otherwise llgal will not regenerate these files if they
already exist, and you may end up with stale copies.  Definitely use
.B -f
between two runs where you've changed the value of
.BR --sx ", " --sy " or " --con "."

.TP
.BI --gencfg " <file>"
Output configuration in
.I file
for future reutilization through
.BR --config "."
If
.B local
is passed as
.IR file ", then the local"
.B .llgal/llgalrc
file is created in each gallery that is processed (in case of recursion).
See
.B CONFIGURATION
for details.

.TP
.BI --option " 'variable = value'"
Modify llgal configuration.
See
.B CONFIGURATION
for details.
Note that
.B --option
may be used several times on the same command line.

.TP
.B -R
Enable recursive mode.
llgal will be run inside subdirectories.
This option might be used either to generate galleries
in all subdirectories, or their captions files, or to
clean recursively, etc.

When generating a gallery, this option implies
.B -S
that means llgal will use all existing subdirectories in no captions
file is defined.
If a captions file is defined, only the
.B DIR:
entries will be entered recursively.
See
.B CAPTIONS
for details abour

Note that recursive behavior does only use the contents
of the captions file to choose which subgalleries to
enter when generating the gallery or the captions file.
All other behaviors, including recursive cleaning (
.B -R
used together with
.B --clean
or
.BR --cleanall ),
will
.B not
check whether a subdirectory is in the captions file.
All not-dot-begining subdirectories will be cleaned.

.TP
.B -v, --verbose
Display notice messages.


.SH SELECTING FILES

.TP
.B -A
All files in the current directory will get a slides,
except .html or dot-begining files.
Files are matched as images or movies first, and then
reverted as simple files instead.
See
.B -S
for details about adding slides for subdirectories.

.TP
.BI --exclude " <s>"
Exclude files whose name matches
.IR <s> .

.TP
.BI --include " <s>"
Include files whose name matches
.I <s>
and where previously excluded.

.TP
.BI -P " <subdir>"
Use photos in the subdirectory instead of the working directory.
May be used multiple times to group multiple subdirectories in the
same gallery.
The path of the subdirectory must be given as a relative path
(relative to
.BR . " or to the path given to " -d ")."

.TP
.BI --Ps
Add a horizontal line and the subdirectory name as a title at
the begining of each section.

.TP
.B -S
Each subdirectory will get a dedicated slide.
If a captions file exists, only the subdirectories that
it defines will be processed.
If no captions file exists, llgal will process all subdirectories but
those whose name begins with a dot.

Contrary to
.B -R
this option will not make llgal run recursively in subdirectories.
.B -S
does only define the list of subdirectories that appear
in the current gallery.


.SH LAYOUT OPTIONS

.TP
.B -a
Write image dimensions and sizes under each thumbnail on the index page,
and under each slide if
.BR --sx " or " --sy
was passed.
This only works if the ImageMagick command
.B identify
is present.

.TP
.B --ad
Like
.B -a
but write only the image dimensions.

.TP
.B --as
Like
.B -a
but write only the image sizes.

.TP
.BI --asu " <s>"
Allow to define the unit used to show file sizes.
Default is \fB"kB"\fR.

.TP
.BI --cc " [<s>]"
Generates
.I captions
from image comment tag.
If no argument is given, llgal first tries the standard comment (for
instance JFIF or GIF), and then tries Exif comments if the previous
one is empty.

An argument such as
.I std
or
.I exif
might be added to force the use of only standard comment
or only Exif comment.

An argument such as
.I exif,std
will make llgal try Exif comment first.

An argument such as
.I std+exif
will use the combination of standard and Exif comments.

Passing
.B --cc
without argument is thus equivalent to passing
.B --cc
.IR std,exif .

.TP
.B --cf
Generates
.I captions
from file names (strips suffix).

.TP
.B --ct
Add image timestamp tag to the generated captions.

.TP
.BI --ctf " strftime_format"
Change timestamp in captions using a
.B strftime
format.

.TP
.BI --codeset " codeset"
Change the encoding in the header of the generated HTML pages.
By default, the encoding is got from the locale configuration.
.TP
.BI --con " options"
Command line options to pass on to
.B convert
internally (see its man page).  This affects all thumbnails
and, if
.BR --sx " or " --sy
is given, the medium-size slides too.  You can set the
.B -quality
or go crazy with
.BR -negate ", " -noise ", etc."
(the last two only work with
.BR convert " if " ImageMagick " is installed)."
.B --con
may be used several times on the same command line.

.TP
.BI --exif " [<tag1,tag2,...>]"
Display a table of EXIF tags under each image slide.
If an argument is given, it contains a comma-separated list
of tags.
The tag names have to be passed as shown by
.BR "exiftool -list" .
If no argument is given, all available Exif tags are displayed.

The tags are displayed using their description as given by
.BR "exiftool -s myimage" .

.TP
.BI -i " <file>"
Name of the main thumbnail index file.  The default is
.BR index ,
as desirable for most web servers.
The default extension is
.B html
and might be changed with
.B --php
or the
.I www_extension
configuration option.

.TP
.B -k
Use the image captions for the HTML slide titles.
The default behavior is to use the image names.

.TP
.B -L
Do not create slides and thumbnails for links (including video, file and url),
but list them as a text line between thumbnails row in the main gallery index.
Text entries are also listed as a text line in the index, but they still
appear as a slide.
Might be used when the directory only contains subgalleries and thus does
not need any slide or thumbnail.

.TP
.BI --lang " locale"
Change the locale used to translate the text that is automatically
generated in the HTML pages.
Note that the
.B LANGUAGE
environment variable might prevent this option from working if set.

.TP
.B --li
Replace link labels in slides (usually
.BR Index ", " Prev " and " Next )
with images (usually
.IR index.png ", " prev.png " and " next.png ).

.TP
.B --lt
Replace link labels in slides (usually
.BR Prev " and " Next )
with a thumbnail to preview previous/next slide.
If passed together with
.BR --li ,
thumbnail preview is used for links to previous/next slide
while the image is for the link to the index is kept.

.TP
.B -n
Use the image file names for the HTML slide files.  Otherwise
the default behavior is to simply name your slides
.IR 1.html ", " 2.html ", "
and so on.

.TP
.B --nc
Omit the image count from the captions.

.TP
.BI --next-gal " <url>"
Add links to the previous gallery located by
.IR <url> .
This option is used internally for recursive galleries, and
thus not documented in
.BR --help .

.TP
.B --nf
Omit the film effect altogether.  For a simpler look you
can also set the thumbnail background to be the same as the main
index page background with the tile background-color option in the
.IR llgal.css " file."

.TP
.BI -p " <n>"
The cellpadding value of the thumbnail index tables.
The default is
.BR 3 .

.TP
.B --php
Change the default extension of generated webpages from
.I html
to
.IR php .
Note that template names are not modified and keep their
.I html
extension even if they contain some PHP code.
Note that llgal will only remove existing webpages corresponding to
this extension when generating a new gallery or cleaning.

.TP
.B --parent-gal
Add links to the parent directory.
This option is used internally for recursive galleries, and
thus not documented in
.BR --help .
These links are stored as a header and a footer for the index.
The text in the links might be changed through the
.B parent_gallery_link_text
configuration option.

.TP
.BI --prev-gal " <url>"
Add links to the previous gallery located by
.IR <url> .
This option is used internally for recursive galleries, and
thus not documented in
.BR --help .

.TP
.B --Rl
Add links between subgalleries.

.TP
.B -s
For the simplest setup, omit all HTML slides.  Clicking the thumbnails on
the main page will just take users to the plain image files.

.TP
.BI --sort " [rev]<name|iname|size|time|none>"
Change sort criteria when scanning files in the working directory.
Default is \fB"name"\fR.
Setting to the empty string means
.BR none .
.BR iname " is case insensitive sort by names."
.BR date " means " time .
.BR rev " might be added for reverse sort."

.TP
.BI --sx " <n>"
Instead of using the original image in the slides, insert a scaled
image whose width is less than
.BR <n> " pixels."
Useful if your digital camera spits out large images, like 1600x1200.
Clicking on the scaled copies in the HTML slides lets users see the
full unscaled images.
The default is
.B 0
(width is unlimited).
You must use
.B -f
to force regeneration of scaled images if you want to change the value of
.BR --sx .

.TP
.BI --sy " <n>"
Instead of using the original image in the slides, insert a scaled
image whose height is less than
.BR <n> " pixels."
Useful if your digital camera spits out large images, like 1600x1200.
Clicking on the scaled copies in the HTML slides lets users see the
full unscaled images.
The default is
.B 0
(height is unlimited).
You must use
.B -f
to force regeneration of scaled images if you want to change the value of
.BR --sy .

.TP
.BI --templates " <dir>"
Add a directory to the list of template locations.

.TP
.BI --title " <s>"
Substitutes the string
.I <s>
for
.B <!--TITLE-->
in the index.
The default is
.BR "Index of Pictures" .

.TP
.BI --tx " <n>"
Scale thumbnails so that their width is at most
.IR <n> " pixels."
The default is
.BR 113 .
If
.B 0
is used, the width is unlimited.
You must use
.B -f
to force regeneration of thumbnails if you want to change the value of
.BR --tx .

.TP
.BI --ty " <n>"
Scale thumbnails so that their height is at most
.IR <n> " pixels."
The default is
.BR 75 .
You must use
.B -f
to force regeneration of thumbnails if you want to change the value of
.BR --ty .

.TP
.B -u
Write image captions under each thumbnail on the index page.
If you have a
.I captions
file, then the captions are read from there.

.TP
.BI --uc " <url>"
Assume the CSS file is available on
.I <url>
and thus do not use a local one.
If ending with a slash, the CSS filename will be appended.

.TP
.BI --ui " <url>"
Assume that the filmtile image and index/prev/next slide link images
are available on
.I <url>
and thus do not use local ones.
Their filename will be appended to the given location.
Each image location may be also changed independently
(See
.B CONFIGURATION
for the list of configuration options).

.TP
.BI -w " <n>"
Set the thumbnail rows to be
.I <n>
images wide in the main index file.
Default is
.BR 5 .

.TP
.B --www
Make all generated files world-readable.

.TP
.BI --wx " <n>"
Set the thumbnail rows to be
.I <n>
pixels wide at maximum. The number of thumbnails per row, given in
.B -w
is reduced if necessary. Default is to honor
.B -w
without regard to the resulting row width.


.SH CAPTIONS
When called with
.B --gc
llgal generates (or updates if already existing) the
.I captions
file in the
.I .llgal/
subdirectory.

When
.B --gc
is not passed, if the
.I captions
file exists, llgal will automatically use it to generate slide
captions in the gallery.
If
.I captions
does not exist, llgal generates captions on the fly and use them in
the gallery.

Generating the
.I captions
file with
.B --gc
before actually using it makes it possible to modify them
(especially to add comments)
or change the order of the slides in the gallery

file is inserted at the top of the file to detail
the syntax.


.SH CONFIGURATION

Before parsing command line options, llgal reads several configuration
files. It starts with
.I /etc/llgal/llgalrc
then reads
.I $HOME/.llgal/llgalrc
and finally the
.I .llgal/llgalrc
file in the gallery directory.

Additional configuration files may also be defined with the
.B --config
option.
These will be parsed during command-line parsing, when
.B --config
is met.

All these files may change llgal configuration in the same way command
line options do, and even more.
All following options may also be used on the command line through
.B --option

.RE

Additionally, it is possible to define use custom fields in the
templates and define their replacement with some
.B REPLACE
entries in the captions file.
See
.B CAPTIONS
for details.


.SH LANGUAGE
The language that llgal uses to generate text in HTML pages is chosen
from the localization configuration.
If the chosen language is available in llgal translations, it will be
used instead of the default english.

As usual with
.BR gettext ,
it is possible to override the
localisation configuration by changing
.BR LANG ", " LC_MESSAGES " or " LANGUAGE
environment variables.

If the desired language is not available in llgal translations,
or if the user wishes to change the text values, he might create an
additional configuration file (or modify the system-wide one) to
update all configuration options of the
.B Text
section.

The locale configuration might be overriden with the
.B --lang
option or
.B language
configuration option.
But, the
.B LANGUAGE
environment variable appears to prevent this from working if set.


.SH CHARACTER ENCODING
If a filename contains non-ascii characters which are not safely
representable in a URL, llgal will escape them using the method RFC
2396 specifies.
This may raise problems if the web server has a different notion
of character encoding than the machine llgal runs on.
See also
.I http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/appendix/notes.html#h-B.2

Character encoding is chosen from the locale configuration and set in
the HTML headers.
It may be overriden by using
.B --codeset
or the
.B codeset
configuration option.


.SH NOTES
Note that all numerical options may be resetted to their default value
by setting them a negative value.


.SH FILES
.RE
.IR /etc/llgal/llgalrc ", " $HOME/.llgal/llgalrc ", " .llgal/llgalrc

.RE
.I /usr/share/llgal/slidetemplate.html
.RS
The default file used to generate slides.
.RE
These files are not required on the website.
But, llgal will use them to generate HTML webpages of the gallery
by replacing several fields with text or images.
See
.B TEMPLATES
for details.

The user may change all these templates by storing files with
the same name in its user template directory
.I $HOME/.llgal/
or in the local
.I .llgal/
directory.
The former defines user-specific templates that will be used
each time the user generate a gallery.
The later defines gallery-specific templates that will be used
for the local gallery.
A local template is used by default if it exists.
A user template is used if it exists and no local template exists.
Finally, system-wide templates are used if no local and user
templates override them.

It is also possible to add custom template directories (with
.BR --templates )
that will be used to get templates before trying in the user
and in the system-wide template directories.

The option
.B --gt
might be used to get copies of template files in the local
or in the user template directory.


.SH EXAMPLES
Run
.B llgal
in a directory with
.IR jpg ", " gif ", " png ", " mpg " or " avi
files to see what it does.  Then
play with the options described above and use
.B -h
if you need a quick listing.


.SH BUGS
There are always some.  If you find any let me know.
