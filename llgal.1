.SH NAME
llgal \- Loulous Image Gallery generator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B llgal 
.I [-option1 -option2 ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B llgal
is a quick and easy program for placing your images online with just
one command-line.  It generates a pretty good-looking set of W3-compliant
static HTML slides even with its default settings.  To try it out just run 
.B llgal 
in a directory with
.IR jpg ", " gif " or " png
files and check the output in a web browser.  You can adjust the
appearance of the image gallery with the many options listed below or
(if you know a bit of HTML) by modifying the
.IR ".indextemplate.html" , " .slidetemplate.html " and " llgal.css"
files that appeared in your image directory.
.B llgal
also checks for the existence of a
.I "$HOME/.llgal"
directory where users can store their own templates, overriding
the site-wide 
.IR "/usr/share/llgal" .

.BR llgal " needs " Perl
to run and it also relies on a few other programs that come standard
with most Linux distributions.  It relies on the
.B ImageMagick
package first if available, otherwise it falls back onto
.BR cjpeg "/" djpeg "/" pnmscale " for processing"
.IR jpg " files.  The command "
.BR convert " of the " ImageMagick " package is required to process"
.IR gif " and " png
files and the
.BR identify " command enables " llgal
to include IMG HEIGHT and WIDTH tags in the HTML it generates.

If you really like
.B llgal
please see the file
.IR THANKS " (normally in " /usr/share/llgal/ ")."
If you wish to make a donation (whatever
.B llgal
is worth to you or however small) send it via PayPal to
.IR epop@stanford.edu "."
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -a
Write image dimensions and sizes under each thumbnail on the index page.
This only works if the ImageMagick command
.BR identify " is present."
.TP
.B --ad
Like
.B -a
but write only the image dimensions.
.TP
.B --as
Like
.B -a
but write only the image sizes.
.TP
.BI --bigy " <n>"
Like
.B -y
but operates on the image slides, not the thumbnails.  Scales image
slides to some medium height (e.g.
.IR 400 "),"
adjusting their width accordingly.  Useful if your digital camera
spits out large images, like 1600x1200.  The originals aren't affected,
but scaled copies of your images are stored with the 
.I ".slide"
prefix and thumbnails link to these copies.  Clicking on the scaled
copies in the HTML slides lets users see the full unscaled images.
You must use
.B -f
between two consecutive runs when you've changed the value of
.BR "--bigy" .
.TP
.BI -c
First generate and then publish image slide captions. The first invocation of
.B llgal -c
generates a
.I .captions
file that you may edit.  The format of this file is very simple.
You should only have to enter your captions after the
.I ----
separator.  You may rearrange the image order at this point and 
also leave out some pictures by simply placing a pound
.RI ( # )
sign at the beginning of their respective lines.  A second invocation of
.B llgal -c
will read your
.I .captions
file, include your captions in the slides and rearrange them if necessary.
.TP
.BI -C
.RI Like " -c"
but preserve file names as captions when generating the
.I .captions
file (strips file name suffix).
.TP
.BI --con " options"
Command line options to pass on to
.BR convert " or " cjpeg
internally (see their man pages).  This affects all thumbnails
and, if
.BI --bigy
is given, the medium-size slides too.  You can set the
.I -quality
or go crazy with
.IR -negate ", " -noise ", etc."
(the last two only work with
.BR convert " if " ImageMagick " is installed."
.TP
.BI -d " <dir>"
Operate on image files in directory
.IR <dir> ,
which is also where the HTML and thumbnail files will be generated.
The default is the current directory.
.TP
.BI -f
Force thumbnail regeneration.  Also forces medium-slide regeneration if
.BI --bigy
is given.  Otherwise
.B llgal
will not regenerate these files if they already exist, and you may
end up with stale copies.  Definitely use
.BI -f
between two runs where you've changed the value of 
.BR --bigy " or " --con "."
.TP
.BI -h
Display brief help, same as
.BR "--help" .
.TP
.BI --help
Display brief help, same as
.BR "-h" .
.TP
.BI -i " <file>"
Name of the main thumbnail index file.  The default is
.IR index.html ,
as desirable for most web servers.
.TP
.BI -k
Use the image captions for the HTML slide titles.
The default behavior is to use the image names.
.TP
.BI -n
Use the image file names for the HTML slide files.  Otherwise
the default behavior is to simply name your slides
.IR 1.html ", " 2.html ", "
and so on.
.TP
.BI -p " <n>"
The cellpadding value of the thumbnail index tables.
The default is 3.
.TP
.BI -r
Omit the film reel effect altogether.  For a simpler look you
can also set the thumbnail background to be the same as the main
index page background with the tile background-color option in the
.IR llgal.css " file."
.TP
.B -s
For the simplest setup, omit all HTML slides.  Clicking the thumbnails on 
the main page will just take users to the plain image files.
.TP
.BI -t " <n>"
Height (in pixels) of the tiled image used to simulate the top
and bottom "film reel" effect on the thumbnail index page.  This
is 21 for the default
.I .tile.png
image used, but you should set it otherwise if you replace that
file with your own design.
.TP
.BI -u
Write image captions under each thumbnail on the index page.
If you have a
.I .captions
file (see options -c or -C) then the captions are read from there,
else the file names are used (but the file extension is stripped).
.TP
.BI -w " <n>"
Set the thumbnail rows to be
.I <n>
images wide in the main index file.  Default is 5.
.TP
.BI -wx " <n>"
Set the thumbnail rows to be 
.I <n>
pixels wide at maximum. The number of thumbnails per row, given in
.BI -w
is reduced if necessary. Default is to honor
.BI -w
without regard to the resulting row width.
.TP
.BI -x
Omit the image count from the captions.
.TP
.BI -y " <n>"
Scale all thumbnails to the same height of 
.IR <n> " pixels."
The default is 75 pixels.
.TP
.BI --xy " <n>"
Scale thumbnails to
.I <n>
pixels along their longest dimension.  This value is passed to
.B pnmscale
and only works properly for
.I jpg
images.
.TP
.BI --www
Make all
.B llgal
files world-readable.
.TP
.BI --title " <s>"
Substitutes the string 
.I <s>
for "<!--TITLE-->" in the index. The default is "Index of Pictures".
.TP
.BI --clean
Remove all files
.B llgal
may have created earlier. This includes thumbnails, scaled down slides, all 
HTML files, caption file, reel-effect picture, indextemplate and slidetemplate 
and the stylesheet file.
.SH FILES
.I /usr/share/llgal/indextemplate.html
.RS
The default index template file.
.RE
.I /usr/share/llgal/slidetemplate.html
.RS
The default file used to generate slides.
.RE
.I /usr/share/llgal/llgal.css
.RS
The default style sheet template.
.RE
.I /usr/share/llgal/tile.png
.RS
The tiled image used for the "film reel" effect.
.RE
All four files are copied to your image directory as dotfiles the
first time you run
.BR llgal .
Modify the local copies (but keep their names) if you need to further 
alter the appearance of your slide show (also see
.BR "-t" ")."
.B llgal
also checks for the existence of a
.I "$HOME/.llgal"
directory where users can store their own templates, overriding
the site-wide 
.IR "/usr/share/llgal" .
.SH EXAMPLES
Run
.B llgal
in a directory with 
.IR jpg " or " gif
images to see what it does.  Then
play with the options described above and use
.B -h
if you need a quick listing.
.SH BUGS
There are always some.  If you find any let me know.
I don't have much time to keep tweaking
.B llgal
but if any major bugs pop up I probably ought to fix them.
