Description: Online gallery generator
 llgal is a HTML gallery generator for images, videos, text and links.
 It is based on igal and adds supports for various types of slides including
 movies, text, links and subdirectories and several features such as the
 addition of headers and footers in generated HTML files or the generation
 of slide captions from JPEG EXIF or GIF comments
 llgal generates nice web-pages through very simple HTML code that does not
 require anything like php or javascript.
