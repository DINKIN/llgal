How-to upgrade a gallery from igal to llgal ?
=============================================

1. File location
----------------
igal places all files in the working directory with existing images.
	.captions
	.indextemplate.html
	.slidetemplate.html
	.slide_<image>
	.thumb_<image>
	.tile.png
	igal.css

llgal moves all these files in a .llgal.files, making the starting dot useless.
.slide_<image> is also replaced by .scaled_<image>.
	.llgal.files/captions
	.llgal.files/indextemplate.html
	.llgal.files/slidetemplate.html
	.llgal.files/scaled_<image>
	.llgal.files/thumb_<image>
	.llgal.files/tile.png
	.llgal.files/llgal.css

2. CSS style sheet
------------------
The CSS style sheet has been updated. If you modified it, you should probably
diff against the original igal.css, and apply the difference (by hand) to llgal.css.

3. Command line options
-----------------------
All long options (more than one character) now requires a double dash.

igal -clean is now llgal --cleanall since llgal --clean only removes file that
have not been modified.

Captions generation uses --gc instead of -c.
Captions usage still uses -c.
Captions generation from filename is --cf instead of -C

Do not show image counter in captions is now --nc instead of -x.

4. How-to upgrade
-----------------
If you don't care about processing time:
* Save your .captions file if it exists
* Note the command line you used when creating the gallery (see in the header of index.html)
* Remove everything but the images with igal -clean
* Create a .llgal.files directory and move your captions files inside
  (remember it is now named captions instead of .captions)
* Run llgal with same options (see section 3 for details)

Recomputing the whole might be long, especially if you have tons of images,
since thumbnails (and scaled images if --bigy/--bigxy is passed) have to
be generated.
If you don't want to regenerate these, see section 1 and
move .thumb_* and .slide_* files to .llgal.files/thumb_* and scaled_*
so that llgal uses them.
